// We are receiving a string, we are trying to find the character that appears the most times in the string
// Will numbers be involved?
// Will I always be receiving a string?
// Would you like to count puncuation as a character?

// mostFreqChar("abracadabra") // 'a' => 5
// mostFreqChar("why") // 'w' => 1
// mostFreqChar("opposite") 'o' => 2
